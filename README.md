A project about threads for Hive Helsinki coding school

The philosophers project aims to teach a student how to create, manage and use threads in C programs.
The philosophers sit around a round table, each having their own personal fork. A philosopher must try
not to starve to death, but in order to eat they need access to both their own and one of their neighbors
forks. After eating a philosopher has to sleep a certain amount of time and otherwise they are free to do
some thinking. Philosophers can't communicate with each other and must manage their own time.

### Concepts

- Mutexes
- Data races
- Shared resource handling
